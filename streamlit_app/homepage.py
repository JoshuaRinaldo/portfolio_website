I am an AI/ML engineer currently based in Kelowna, British Columbia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.

I began studying machine learning and computer science during my
undergraduate physics degree, where I was introduced to data science
and computational physics. I went on to complete a bachelor's of
education, and then entered the workforce as an AI/ML engineer.

Outside of work, I love hiking and camping, tabletop roleplaying
games, and Muay Thai.
